# Simple Shell Project
Team Project -> By John Njuguna and Samwel Omariba in Creating our own shell.

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of a command-line shell, created as part of our coursework. It allows users to interact with the operating system through text-based commands.

## Features
- Basic command execution
- Input and output redirection
- Support for environment variables
- Scripting capabilities
- Minimal job control features

## Usage
1. Compile the source code:
   ```
   gcc -o main main.c
   ```
2. Run the executable:
   ```
   ./main
   ```
3. Enter commands at the prompt and press Enter to execute.
